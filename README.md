# CPC-UAEH Competitive Programming Solutions

This repository collects practice solutions for problems from the CPC-UAEH online judge and its training camps. The submissions are primarily written in C++ and cover a wide range of algorithmic topics that appear in programming contests.

## Repository contents
- **Individual problem solutions:** Each `.cpp` file in the repository root corresponds to a specific CPC-UAEH problem statement.
- **Training camp materials:** The `campamento_fall_2025`, `campamento_mayo_2025`, and `xpocet-abril-2025` folders contain additional exercises and reference implementations used in CPC-UAEH workshops.

## Online judge
You can explore problem statements and test your own solutions on the CPC-UAEH judge: [https://cpcuaeh-judge.dynns.com/](https://cpcuaeh-judge.dynns.com/).

## How to use
1. Browse the repository to find a problem of interest.
2. Compile a solution locally, for example:
   ```bash
   g++ -std=c++17 -O2 -pipe -static -s ExampleProblem.cpp -o ExampleProblem
   ```
3. Run the compiled binary with the input format specified on the judge page.

Feel free to reuse these solutions for learning and benchmarking when practicing for CPC-UAEH contests.
